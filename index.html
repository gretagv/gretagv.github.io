                            He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he
                            had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.  In the first
                            forty days a boy had been with him.  But after forty days without a
                            fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely
                            and finally _salao_, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy
                            had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish
                            the first week.  It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each
                            day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry
                            either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was
                            furled around the mast.  The sail was patched with flour sacks and,
                            furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.
