                        <h2>The Old Man and the Sea</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he
                        had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.  In the first
                        forty days a boy had been with him.  But after forty days without a
                        fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely
                        and finally _salao_, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy
                        had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish
                        the first week.  It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each
                        day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry
                        either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was
                        furled around the mast.  The sail was patched with flour sacks and,
                        furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.
                        <br>
                        <br>The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his
                        neck.  The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings
                        from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks.  The blotches
                        ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased
                        scars from handling heavy fish on the cords.  But none of these scars
                        were fresh.  They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
                        <br>
                        <br>Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same
                        color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
                        <br>
                        <br>"Santiago," the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the
                        skiff was hauled up.  "I could go with you again.  We've made some
                        money."
                        <br>
                        <br>The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.
                        <br>
                        <br>"No," the old man said.  "You're with a lucky boat.  Stay with them."
                        <br>
                        <br>"But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we
                        caught big ones every day for three weeks."
                        <br>
                        <br>"I remember," the old man said.  "I know you did not leave me because
                        you doubted."
                        <br>
                        <br>"It was papa made me leave.  I am a boy and I must obey him."
                        <br>
                        <br>"I know," the old man said.  "It is quite normal."
                        <br>
                        <br>"He hasn't much faith."
                        <br>
                        <br>"No," the old man said.  "But we have.  Haven't we?"
                        <br>
                        <br>"Yes," the boy said.  "Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then
                        we'll take the stuff home."
                        <br>
                        <br>"Why not?" the old man said.  "Between fishermen."
                        <br>
                        <br>They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old
                        man and he was not angry.  Others, of the older fishermen, looked at
                        him and were sad.  But they did not show it and they spoke politely
                        about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and
                        the steady good weather and of what they had seen.  The successful
                        fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin
                        out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men
                        staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they
                        waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana.  Those
                        who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other
                        side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their
                        livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and
                        their flesh cut into strips for salting.
                        <br>
                        <br>When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the
                        shark factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odour
                        because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it
                        was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
